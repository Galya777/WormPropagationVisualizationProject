I tried the project to be developed with as less AI as possible.
I used chatGPT for management purposes mainly: developing the plan and for information gathering.
With the chat I found out the information about the viruses, developed the strategy and the network topology.
Also, it helped me a lot with the documentation.
Sometimes I used it for debugging tool for fixing errors and explain why a certain error occurs.
